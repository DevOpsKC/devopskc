## Before you get started

### Code of Conduct

Please make sure to read and observe our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) before contributing.

### Setting up your development environment

If you havenâ€™t set up your environment, please find resources [here](readme.md).

## Contributing

DevOpsKC is open source, but many of the people working on it do so as their day job. In order to avoid forcing people to be "at work" effectively 24/7, we want to establish some semi-formal protocols around development. Hopefully, these rules make things go more smoothly. If you find that this is not the case, please complain loudly.

As a potential contributor, your changes and ideas are welcome at any hour of the day or night, weekdays, weekends, and holidays. Please do not ever hesitate to ask a question or send a pull request.
